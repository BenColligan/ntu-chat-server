# python-chat-server
This program was my 1st year coursework for the module Computer Science Programming. It's a primitive chat server solution intended for use, in the future,
as a chat service for specifically Nottingham Trent University students/staff. I got an Exceptional 1st for this submission. This repository also includes
.pdf of the documentation I submitted along side the source code. This program is developing using Python, more specifically using the TKinter library for
GUI.
